This extension serves as a syntax highlighting tool for writing ai scripts in AoE2. It will apply this highlighting to any `.per` files that are loaded in vscode.

## Features
### Syntax Highlighting

This extension currently provides very rudimentary syntax highlighting as demonstrated below (image uses the `Dark+` color theme):

## Known Issues

This is an alpha version afterall, so there are going to be issues:

- [ ] Numbers are still highlighted even if they appear at the end of a variable, but only if also proceded by a dash.

## Contributing
Feel free to submit issues to the github repository, and I will try to look into them when I have time.

Alternatively, for the real go-getters out there, you can fork the repository, make changes and submit a pull request!

## Release Notes
Please refer to the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for a reference of changes in this and previous releases.
